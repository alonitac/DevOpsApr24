# Linux Sockets

A **socket** is a communication endpoint that allows processes to communicate with each other, either on the same machine or across a network. 
A socket is identified by a unique combination of an **IP address** and a **port number**, and it is associated with a particular protocol, usually TCP or UDP.

Linux sockets provide a standardized interface for networking communication, and they are used by many network applications, such as web browsers, email clients, etc...
Sockets can be used to establish connections between clients and servers, or to implement peer-to-peer communication between two applications.

## The Client-Server model

Most networking applications today are designed around a client-server relationship.
The **client** is usually an application acting on behalf of a person, such as a web browser accessing google.com.
The **server** is generally an application that is providing some service, such as supplying the content of the web page of google.com.

Servers are **Highly Available (HA)**. Usually, processes implementing server are running as [linux services](linux_processes.md#services), started at boot time, and continue to run until the machine is shutdown.
Usually, clients can use the server's **hostname** (e.g. google.com, console.aws.com...), which is a friendly known name that can be converted into the IP Address of the server using the **Domain Name Service (DNS)** system.

The below figure illustrates multiple clients communicating with the same server:

## Socket communication demonstrated 

This exercise will demonstrate a client-server communication over a TCP socket.
The server should run on different machine than the client.

1. Lightly review the code in `simple_linux_socket/server.c`, especially the system calls `socket()`, `accept()`, `bind()`, `listen()`, `recv()`.
2. From your bash terminal, compile the code by `gcc -o server server.c`.
3. Run by `./server`.
4. From **another host**, use `nc <server ip> <server port>` command to establish a TCP connection and send data to the server.

We will now use some important linux networking tools to investigate what happens.

The `netstat` command can be used to display a variety of networking information, including open ports.
When a port is used by a socket, it is referred to as an **open port**.

As `./server` process is started, it first allocates a `socket`, `bind`s it to the port 9999, and begins `listen`ing for connections.
At some point later, the `nc` process in some another host is started.
It also allocates a socket, and requests to connect to port 9999 of the server host.
Because `nc` did not request a particular port number, the kernel provides a random one (52038 in the below output).
As the client requests the connection, it provides its own IP address and the (randomly assigned) port number to the server.

The server chooses to `accept` the connection.
The established socket is now identified by the combined IP address and port number of both the client and server.

The below is an output example **from the client machine** that is currently holds an `ESTABLISHED` connection with the server:

```console
myuser@hostname:~$ netstat -tuna

```

The below is an output example **from the server machine**, while the server is running and connected to the above mentioned client:

```console

udp6       0      0 ::1:323                 :::* 
```

Once the socket is established, the `nc` process and the `./server` process can read information from and write information to one another as easily as reading and writing from a file.

## Well-known and privileged ports, more on `netstat`

In the Internet, there are well-known services, such as a web server, ftp , or SMTP (email) server.
On Linux machines, a catalog of well known services, and the ports assigned to them, is maintained in the file `/etc/services`.
Notice that both the client and server need to agree on the appropriate port number, so the `/etc/services` file is just as important on the client's machine as on the server's.

Unlike clients, processes implementing servers generally request which port they would like to bind to.
Only one process may bind to a port at any given time (why?).
Ports less than 1024 are known as **privileged ports**, and treated specially by the kernel.
Only processes running as the `root` user may bind to privileged ports.

We now analyze a few extracted lines from the above output of the `netstat -tuna` command.

```text 
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State      
tcp   0      0      0.0.0.0:9999            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     
```

This socket is bound to all interfaces (`0.0.0.0` means "all IP addresses") in the `LISTENING` state, one on port 9999.
This can be recognized as the process of our server that actively listening for client connections.

The next example is listening for connections as well, but only on the loopback address:

```text
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State      
tcp   0      0      127.0.0.1:631           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN 
```

It must belong to services expecting to receive connections from other processes on the local machine only. 
To determine what services these ports belong to, we do some greping from the `/etc/services` file.

```console
ubuntu@13.51.197.134:~$ cat /etc/services | grep 631
ipp		631/tcp				# Internet Printing Protocol
```

Apparently, the process listening on port 631 is listening for print clients. This is probably the `cupsd` printing daemon.

Last example:

```text
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State      
tcp   0      0      127.0.0.1:631           127.0.0.1:59330         ESTABLISHED     
tcp   0      0      127.0.0.1:59330         127.0.0.1:631           ESTABLISHED     
```

These lines reflect both halves of an established connection between two processes, both on the local machine.
The first is bound to port 59330 (probably a randomly assigned client port), and the second to the port 631.
Some process on the local machine must be communicating with the `cupsd` daemon.
